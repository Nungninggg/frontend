# Leave System

# Description

The home page has a form to fill out. You can view information about the leave you've requested, how many days, and how many days you have remaining. There's also an Approved and Disapproved page. The dashboard shows the five most recent requests, pending approval, approved, and disapproved. When you fill out the leave request form, it will be added to Databest.
I didn't finish the History page. I couldn't finish it in time. While I was working, I got an error, so I couldn't complete the History page.
